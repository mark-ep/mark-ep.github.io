                  <p>I'm Mark Pattle, a software engineer working at <a href="http://isardsat.cat">isardSAT</a>. Before that, I studied <i>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Cybernetics</i> at the University of Reading.</p>
                  <p>After spending roughly six years saying "I should make a website", I am finally doing just that. The full site is coming soon.</p>

            <p>This is an example post to show how this site would look if there was actually some content on it, which there isn't. Well, there's this, but this is about nothing. This <i>is</i> nothing, in fact. As I'm sure you can imagine, it is rather difficult to produce a large volume of text that has no meaning or purpose <b>whatsoever</b>. I'm clearly struggling, and this is only the first paragraph. A lesser man would have given in a copy/pasted a load of Lorem Ipsum, but I'm better than that.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps I should write some code. There's probably going to be a lot of code on this site, so it's important that it looks both nice and readable. In-line code might look something like <code>this</code>, which hopefully looks alright. If for any reason I wanted to talk about key-combinations, then I'd probably use a lot of <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>. That was graceful wasn't it &ndash; the way I just slipped those in there. With just as much grace and natural flow, here's a big block of code:</p>
            
            <pre>
def mandlebrot(x, y, max_iters=1000):
  c = complex(x, y)
  z = complex(0, 0)
  
  for i in range(max_iters):
    z = z * z + c
    if abs(z) >= 2:
      return max_iters
  return False
